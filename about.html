<h1>About</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Developer</h2>
<p>
Whether it's writing software or a command-line utility, building a website or web application, spinning up a media server or file server, or hacking at the internals of a Linux distribution, I nearly always have a project going. At this time, I mainly build things for myself, both to keep learning and solve problems in my everyday life. I've also built things for others, most notably a web application called simply <a href="https://github.com/seandavidreed/inventory_manager.git" style="text-decoration: underline">Inventory Manager</a> that is currently in production assisting a coffee shop in monitoring and maintaining its inventory. I'm looking forward to more such projects.

<h2>CS Student</h2>
<p>
Aiming to make a career in IT and software, I'm working on a BS in Computer Science from Western Governors University. Courses like Networks and Security, Computer Architecture, and Discrete Mathematics have both solidified my understanding of fundamental computer science concepts and brought to my attention avenues for further study. In this journey, my interests have grown in many directions. What began four years ago as a singular goal to learn to write code has expanded to an interest in networks, servers, operating systems and kernels like Linux, database design, and even things like digital design.

<h2>Music Instructor</h2>
<p>
For my day job, I'm a music instructor, teaching guitar, bass, and ukulele one-on-one to more than 30 students on a weekly basis. I've been at it for nearly six years. For me, these are the two greatest rewards of teaching, seeing the spark of excitement on a student's face when a concept clicks, and the opportunity to become a much better learner myself. Further, being a teacher has given me an ability to explain complicated things clearly like few other roles can do. Ultimately, I plan to transition away from teaching into IT and software roles, and the skills I've gained will come with me.
