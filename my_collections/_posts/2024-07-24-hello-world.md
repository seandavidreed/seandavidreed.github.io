I’m a Music Instructor working to become a Software Engineer. I’ve been teaching 1-on-1 guitar, bass, and ukulele lessons with over 40 students a week for the past five years. Two of my favorite things about teaching – facilitating eureka moments with my students and becoming a better learner myself.

When I’m not teaching, I’m learning Computer Science. I’ve been self-studying since September 2021, and I’ve discovered a passion for programming, whether that involves building web and CLI applications, tinkering with microcontrollers, or building and training convolutional neural networks .

I’ve approached this effort by curating my own curriculum. Following the suggestions of colleagues who have traveled ahead of me, I’ve completed courses such as CS50x and CS50AI from Harvard EdX, Practical Deep Learning for Coders from fast.ai, and C Programming classes on Udemy.

I’ve read books like Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software, The Art of Clean Code, and Bare Metal C. The Alignment Problem is next on the list.

Most importantly, I’ve designed and implemented my own projects, some of which include a Student Log console application written in C, an Inventory Management Web Application with Django and Python, and a CLI implementation of the board game Azul in Python.

In June of this year, I enrolled at Western Governors University to pursue a BS in Computer Science. I have learned and continue to learn a lot through self-study, but I wanted the formal recognition and coherence that comes with a Computer Science degree.

My main goal now is to find a job or internship as a Software Engineer. I’m ready to put all that I’ve learned into practice. For more information on where I’ve been and what I’m doing, check out my programming log repository on GitHub, which details almost all I’ve been doing for the past few years.
