# 1/14/2022
C language

---

# 1/15/2022
C language (writing my own program, Pythagorean)

---

# 1/16/2022
A couple lessons. Tried out code coach. I’m trying out a two-week free trial. I like this course so far!

---

# 1/17/2022
This app is really helping me solidify what I’ve learned in CS50 and teaching me new material along the way. Finished Code Coach exercise to change decimal to hexadecimal.

---

# 1/18/2022
Completed several lessons and code coach projects. Decided to take a pause on CS50 this week while I use Sololearn to refresh what I’ve learned.

---

# 1/20/2022
Clarified my understanding of pointers. I think I’m finally beginning to understand them! I’m still struggling with how to use pointers in relation to strings.

---

# 1/22/2022
Trying to figure out how to take string inputs and parse them is annoying. Tried working on a code coach where you turn standard time into military time.

---

# 1/25/2022
Struggle and anger! Tried two code coaches that kicked my ass! I didn’t solve them. Man, programming has been nothing but a struggle today!!

---

# 1/27/2022
Void pointers and part of module quiz

---

# 1/28/2022
Trying to solve Military Time code coach. I satisfied more test cases, but case 5 still eludes me.

---
# 1/29/2022
Tried to solve Text Decompressor. Hitting some walls!

---

# 1/30/2022
Solved Text Decompressor! Using Data type “long” seems to work better than “int”. Also, I used “malloc()” and “free()” from the stdlib.h, and this is what solved the last problem.

---

# 1/31/2022
Lesson on structs and typedef. Solved Flowing Words code coach on first try!

---

# 2/1/2022
Solved Credit Card Validator. Learned that a char can easily be converted to int by the following: int num = c - ‘0’; // subtracting the zero character. INSIGHT: need to really focus on pointers

---

# 2/2/2022
Easy Kaleidoscopes Code Coach. I used a pointer to solve this one just for the practice.

---

# 2/3/2022
New Driver’s License Code Coach solved! It was labeled hard too!

---

# 2/4/2022
Working on code coach No Numerals. I want to use an array of strings, and I’m finding it’s a little harder than I thought to sort out. Solved No Numerals, but I don’t like the aesthetic of my code. I want my solutions to be more elegant.

---

# 2/5/2022
Trying out Hofstadter Q Sequence code coach, and it’s kicking my butt! I tried recursion, which satisfied two of the success cases, but any numbers bigger than around 44 take far too long to calculate, if they calculate at all. The solution is Dynamic Programming (or memoization), which I barely understand at this point!

---

# 2/6/2022
A few lessons

---

# 2/7/2022
Trying to solve the day of the week code coach.

---

# 2/8/2022
Day of the week code coach -> learned about the Doomsday rule and an algorithm devised by John Conway to calculate the day for a given date mentally.

---

# 2/9/2022
Finished a couple lessons

---

# 2/10/2022
Finished three lessons and in the process, a section. I have plenty of practice to do!

---

# 2/11/2022
YouTube Link Finder code coach

---

# 2/12/2022
Solved Camel to Snake code coach!

---

# 2/13/2022
Worked on the Day of the Week code coach in VSCode.

---

# 2/14/2022
Made a lot of progress on my Day of the Week code! I’ve solved the Day of the Week challenge! Strangely, one date gives me problems: every time I enter March 13, 1887 or 3/13/1887 I get a Segmentation Fault (signal 11).

---

# 2/15/2022
I’ve continued to edit my Day of the Week code and I found more bugs to squash. I improved the code and it’s time for another few rounds of testing! Downloaded MingW gcc compiler and successfully compiled and ran my wday.c program in Windows Command Prompt!

---

# 2/24/2022
Took a shortcut in the C++ curriculum.

---

# 2/26/2022
Solved a hard code coach - 2D Grid

---

# 2/27/2022
Nearly solved the Password Validator code coach.

---

# 2/28/2022
Solved Password Validator!

---

# 3/1/2022
More C++ lessons. Practiced with pointers: codeforwin.org

---

# 3/10/2022
Practicing with array sorting.

—Guess I needed a break—

---

# 5/11/2022
Doing a little to understand C++ better.

---

# 5/12/2022
A little more with the C++ course - still in the early parts of this course, so it’s easy stuff.

---

# 5/20/2022
Two simple C++ lessons about functions.

---

# 5/26/2022
A bit of C++ study. I know it will be a transition going from C to C++. Solved a Code Coach using C++ to convert CMYK to RGB. Code coach that adds even numbers together C++.

---

# 7/9/2022
A few lessons in C++ (default parameters, function overloading, recursion)

---

# 7/10/2022
A few more lessons & code coaches in C++. Finished module 4 & completed the project, which was rather tricky only because the maths were wonky - the code itself (syntax, operations) made sense. I had to check if a given int was a palindrome, so it had to be reversed. I rightly deduced that the modulo operator would be handy, but I failed to consider how the truncation feature of int division could be useful. Next section is about Classes and Objects! This will be good.

---

# 7/11/2022
A little bit about Classes and Objects; I know this topic will fascinate me greatly!

---

# 7/14/2022
Working on sorting algorithms and a little bit of C++ classes and objects.

---

# 7/15/2022
Using the code playground to mess around with sorting algorithms. I made a bubble sort algo pretty quickly, but I’ve had a hard time making a merge sort algo - the recursive aspect desiccates my brain. Hyperbole aside, I’m gaining understanding of how merge sort works - I got my algo to work (of course I based it off of help I found online) and the execution time is drastically better than that of bubble sort! [Merge Sort in C](https://hackr.io/blog/merge-sort-in-c)

---

# 7/21/2022
Solved a hard level code coach with C++ (however, it didn’t need any OOP functionality). Started trying to build a merge sort algo from scratch - ran into some bugs.

---

# 7/22/2022
By consulting my previous merge sort build, I discovered what I did wrong: I failed to set the for loop iterator equal to the left bound of the sub-array. I set it to 0, which was causing the loop to retrieve the wrong values & overflow.

Stackoverflow.com: searched for definition of stack overflow, integer overflow, buffer overflow. The last of these simply “refers to any case in which a program writes beyond the end of the memory allocated for any buffer.” The first two are specific instances of buffer overflow! Very helpful.

---

# 7/23/2022
Completed a few lessons to get a better handle on classes & objects in C++. Reading the coding-interview-university study checklist on GitHub. I think I want to follow this study plan. Cleaned up my PC today - I need a new laptop soon, I think.

---

# 7/24/2022
Solved a code coach with C++.

---

# 7/26/2022
Decided to work on the Python for Beginners course to help me understand the new syntax.

---

# 7/30/2022
Finished the C++ section on Class and Objects. I was briefly confused about Constructors, but now I understand! For the final project of the section, I had to create an add function for a queue data structure. Now I want to create my own queue from scratch!

C++ Practice: built my own queue! I got it to work much quicker than I expected! Created a class Queue with a constructor, attributes, and methods. Feeling very accomplished. I looked it up and found that I can compile with gcc if I link in the C++ library <-lstdc++>. For the pop() function, I tried to simply move the int pointer to the next element and delete the first element, but it didn’t work: I got a garbage value (not to mention my array would slowly shrink with this method!). Instead, I need the equivalent of realloc() in C++. Evidently, I need to use a library called vector for this. A vector is essentially a dynamic array.

---

# 8/4/2022
Completed a simple code coach in C++.

---

# 9/3/2022
Started the JavaScript course just to get a better handle on the basics; I figure I ought to get comfortable with the basics of web dev even if I don’t find it as interesting as back-end development so far.

---

# 10/23/2022
For fun, I completed a lesson in Python for Beginners. It was ridiculously easy.

---

# 11/5/2022
Completed a Python lesson on while loops. Wondered what are the myriad ways to take input in Python.
