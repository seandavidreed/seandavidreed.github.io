## 12/8/2021
### CS50x Week 0 Lecture

Worked on project. Reminded why I'm not a graphic designer. I hate graphic editing programs! I'm just trying to write the code, not spend an hour trying to figure out how to cut a line.

## 12/9/2021
### CS50x

Worked on my scratch project for Week 0 and made good progress!

## 12/10/2021
### CS50x

Worked through the logic of my scratch game, Bomb Squad. At first, I made a decision tree and found that my initial idea was too complex. I found a simpler solution. I was making it more complicated than it needed to be!

## 12/11/2021
### CS50x

Scratch Project

## 12/12/2021
### CS50x

Scratch Project (to do: fix victory screen, possibly upgrade wire sprites)

## 12/13/2021
### CS50x

Week 0 Scratch Project. Lots of headway. I improved the quality of the sprites. Still unhappy with some of the backdrops. There are a couple bugs to fix.

## 12/14/2021
### CS50x

(Week 0) finished Scratch Project! Probably need to check again for bugs. I intend to pay for the course and submit the project tomorrow!

## 12/15/2021
### CS50x

I paid for the course so I can receive the certificate, and submitted my scratch project for Week 0! Awaiting a grade.

## 12/17/2021
### CS50x

Watched most of Week 1 Lecture (C)

## 12/20/2021
### CS50x

Finished Week 1 Lecture, watched all the shorts & took notes, and submitted hello.c. Chipped away at population.c and ran into some hangups.

## 12/21/2021
### CS50x

Finished population.c! Consulted the discord channel for help on some of the code. Nevermind, check50 showed that I didn't satisfy 3 of the criteria. 😭

## 12/22/2021
### CS50x

FINALLY figured out population.c. Evidently, check50 wanted "n = n + n / 3 - n / 4" not what I wrote initially, "n = n + n / 12"
Completed mario.c (less) successfully. I plan to do (more) as well.

## 12/27/2021
### CS50x

Completed Credit.c! Week 1 is done. On to week 2!

## 12/28/2021
### CS50x

Week 2, Lecture 2.

## 12/29/2021
### CS50x

Week 2, Shorts. Finished all.

## 12/30/2021
### CS50x

(Wk2) Finished Lab 2, Scrabble. This is a personal victory. I went into this lab feeling a little clueless; I was tempted to look at the "help solving" section. Instead, I mustered all my powers of memory, deduction, and investigation to figure it out. I got 100% much quicker than I thought I could! Started on substitution.c

## 12/31/2021
### CS50x

(Wk2) Worked on substitution.c. Hard work! Really had to linger on this one.
