Finished Week 1 Lecture, watched all the shorts & took notes, and submitted hello.c. Chipped away at population.c and ran into some hangups.

Finished population.c! Consulted the discord channel for help on some of the code. Nevermind, check50 showed that I didn't satisfy 3 of the criteria. ðŸ˜­

FINALLY figured out population.c. Evidently, check50 wanted "n = n + n / 3 - n / 4" not what I wrote initially, "n = n + n / 12"
Completed mario.c (less) successfully. I plan to do (more) as well.
