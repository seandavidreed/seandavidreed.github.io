Wk4, finished watching shorts. Completed Lab 4 volume.c (I have to say I’m currently frustrated with this course - it's progressing too fast for me. I stopped keeping up around week 3. Maybe this is just a part of the process. I had to use the “not sure how to solve” option on volume.c)

Wk4 after a hiatus, I return! And with a vengeance. I ripped through several of the problems in the “filter” problem set, and I feel fantastic about it.

# 1/23/2022
Wk4 worked on the filter problem set some more!

---

# 1/24/2022
Wrote a simple program that reverses an array, so I could see what I’m doing wrong with the “blur” filter. The problem was I had been conflating the number of elements of an array with its indices. Since arrays are zero-indexed, the last index of an array will always be the number of elements minus one:
 
```
/*
23, the 1st element is at array[0], and 5, the fifth element is at array[4]
*/

Int array[] = {23, 12, 76, 20, 42};
```

Succeeded in compiling my code for the Recover pset, but when I run it, I get “Segmentation Fault (core dumped)”. However, I’m happy with my progress. Time to debug!

---

# 1/27/2022
Wk4 finished recover.c!! Definitely perused Discord for some help, but I did do nearly all the heavy lifting myself. On to week 5!
