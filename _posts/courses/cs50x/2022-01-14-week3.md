# 1/4/2021
(Wk3) working on runoff.c. I really think I'm in the deep end here. I'm finding myself frustrated! But I will persist a little bit at a time.

# 1/5/2022
(wk3) finished runoff.c! What a relief. I was misunderstanding the usage of a couple key variables. Consulting the discord forum, I figured it out.

---

# 1/7/2022
(wk3) working on tideman.c. Since I found runoff.c such a challenge, I decided I'd better complete the other project from this pset as well. Feeling pretty good about it so far!
