Watched the first half of Lecture 6, which takes us into Python. I have an idea to make another iteration of my Student Log program but with Python as a way to learn the language.

Finished Lecture 6! I know the feeling will pass, but I’m less excited about Python than I was about C and C++. There seems to be something about the low-level, fine-tuning capabilities of C that I really enjoy. Python seems like it relies much more on the intelligence of others. I think that’s it! So far I’ve enjoyed the challenge that C has offered. I’m kinda talking out of my ass here: I bet in a few weeks I’ll find appreciation for Python. Having said all this, I’m intrigued by how much easier file handling and saving data appears to be in Python! My studentlog program could probably be implemented much more cleanly in Python.

Watched week6 short & completed lab6. I’m reminded how much ambiguity CS50x leaves in its problem sets - there’s always a sink or swim feeling that I don’t appreciate. I wish they would give just a little more guidance. I was able to think through a lot of the logic for the lab, but the new syntax had my head swimming. I had to consult the “not sure how to solve” section. I’m a little demoralized, but I know I’ll pull through.
Completed several of the problems for pset6! The wind is back in my sails! Python is making a little more sense.

Thinking I should figure out a book to use for study!

Feeing A LOT better about Python. I must have been having a bad day yesterday. I now know that I can figure out anything I need to know for Python since I’ve really started to speaking the language of programming in general! I think I’m actually going to like this language.

Started working on the dna.py problem and it involves csv files and dictionaries again. I need to watch a few extracurricular videos to get a handle on this!

After much suffering trying to make sense of the new syntax, I solved dna.py. I’m proud to say that I was able to think my way through most of it on my own. That concludes Week 6!
