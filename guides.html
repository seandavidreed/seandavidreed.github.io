<h2>What's Here</h2>
<p>
When I configure a server, tinker with a Linux distribution, flash firmware to an optical drive, establish a remote SSH connection, or compile some complex software from source code, I catalog the process, explaining every step I took. When I make use of guides that others have written or recorded, I make note of it under <i>Resources Used</i>. I write these guides to remind myself of the exact steps I followed to solve a problem, and to offer assistance to anyone who has the same problem.
