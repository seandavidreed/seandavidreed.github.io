# Gesture MIDI Controller

### 2/19/2023
Today, I began brainstorming: how could I start a project that would have personal significance, practicability, and that would help solidify what I’m learning? Once again, synths and audio came to mind. After roaming the internet, I’ve decided to try to build a web application that can generate audio controlled by hand gestures! This file will document the research and build process. Here are the initial steps I've taken:

- Follow the WebAssembly tutorial on MDN Web Docs
- Research available open source audio I/O libraries for C++
  - Found SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library), which was available through APT, by watching [this tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSiFUSQSRYAM36UYQLEFGOAVf95rkQJXQ).

### 2/20/2023
I studied the program produced by yesterdays tutorial and I browsed the SFML API documentation. That familiar fog of unknowing hung around me as I puzzled through the SineWave function. Ultimately, I came to understand it, but I'm not sure I could replicate it from scratch yet. I made some changes to the function mainly to practice C++ syntax, e.g. adding static_cast<> to make any implicit conversions explicit, making  preprocessor directives for SAMPLE_RATE and MAX_AMP, using braced initialization.

```
// SAMPLE_RATE = 44100; MAX_AMP = 32767 (max positive value of signed short)
short SineWave(double time, double freq, double amp) {
    double tpc {SAMPLE_RATE / freq}; // ticks per cycle
    double cycles {time / tpc};
    double rad {TWOPI * cycles};
    short amplitude = static_cast<short>(MAX_AMP * amp);

    short result = static_cast<short>(amplitude * sin(rad));
    return result;
}
```

In studying these things, I'm getting a good picture of just how far I have to go. Now I know that I need to gain a better understanding of the science of sound and how it is represented in a digital environment. Here's my first benchmark: I will build a simple synth that responds to key presses and generates a particular pitch for as long as the key is pressed.

- Remember `ncurses.h` library, that it can handle keyboard input (while key is pressed, etc.)
- Check if SFML can handle the same sort of input. It can!
- Explore SFML documentation carefully to get a grasp on the `<SFML/Window/Keyboard.hpp>` library and the `sound` class (make use of `sound.getStatus()` and `sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(A)`).
- Create 8 SoundBuffers and sample Vectors, 1 for each note in a diatonic scale.
- Create an array of the calculated frequencies given some fundamental - great place to use `constexpr`!

  ```
  constexpr double tonic = 220.0F; // Change this value to change the key signature

  constexpr double scale[8] = {
      tonic, tonic * (9.0/8), tonic * (5.0/4), tonic * (4.0/3),
      tonic * (3.0/2), tonic * (5.0/3), tonic * (15.0/8), tonic * 2
  };
  ```
- Simple program handles sine waves and square waves with polyphony! The computer fans get pretty loud while this program runs, so I'm pretty sure its very inefficient. Here's a [link](../files/sfmlPractice0/main.cpp).

The next step for this project is to improve the current while loop with the use of events. Furthermore, I'd like to start exploring the embedded side soon.

### 2/21/2023
Worked out some of the kinks in my implementation of TriangleWave and SawToothWave. I'm still a little unsure why they are quieter than the SineWave and SquareWave. Also, sometimes certain notes in the scale are louder than others; I haven't figured out why that is. I want to see if SFML will let me render a graph to display the waveform. That would really help me see what is going on with these functions:

```
short SawToothWave(int samplePart, double frequency, double amplitude) {
    int samplesPerCycle = static_cast<int>(SAMPLE_RATE / frequency);
    int halfCycle {samplesPerCycle / 2};
    // Treat each cycle as its own discrete set
    int cyclePart {samplePart % samplesPerCycle};
    short amp = static_cast<short>(MAX_AMP * amplitude);

    short result;
    if (cyclePart < halfCycle) {
        result = static_cast<short>(amp * (cyclePart / halfCycle));
    } else {
        result = static_cast<short>(amp * ((cyclePart - samplesPerCycle) / halfCycle));
    }
    return result;
}

short TriangleWave(int samplePart, double frequency, double amplitude) {
    int samplesPerCycle = static_cast<int>(SAMPLE_RATE / frequency);
    // Treat each cycle as its own discrete set
    int cyclePart {samplePart % samplesPerCycle};
    int halfCycle {samplesPerCycle / 2};
    short amp = static_cast<short>(MAX_AMP * amplitude);

    short result;
    if (cyclePart < halfCycle) {
        result = static_cast<short>(amp * (cyclePart / halfCycle));
    } else {
        result = static_cast<short>(amp * ((samplesPerCycle - cyclePart) / halfCycle));
    }
    return result;
}
```

Later today, I read up on the Graphics module in SFML and how to use the RenderWindow class. Using a VertexArray, I was able to successfully represent the sine wave for one of my tones in a separate window! However, when I tried to apply it to every tone, I couldn’t get the vertices to behave properly and they didn’t print in the window. I’ll try again tomorrow.

### 2/22/2023 [sfmlPractice1](../files/sfmlPractice1/main.cpp)
Using the same for loop as with the samples, I was able to initialize an SFML type VertexArray with the sample values as coordinate points. I found that I had already done this correctly yesterday. The real problem was with the main program loop, where I did not call the `ss::RenderWindow` method `RenderWindow::display()` after each draw event. I learned that all changes made to the RenderWindow object will only be seen after the `RenderWindow::display()` method is called.

With the waveforms visible in the window, I was able to see what was wrong with `SawToothWave()` and `TriangleWave()`, the two functions that were left to me to design in the tutorial video. Their structures were completely wrong. For a while I thought it was only an issue with the formula I wrote, but when a new formula, mathematically identical to the previous ones that failed, suddenly worked, I realized that I had been facing a data type error all along. In the complexity of mingling `short`, `double`, and `int`, there had been too many narrowing conversions, explicit and implicit, that had corrupted the data. To solve the problem, I made everything type `double` and only called `static_cast<short>` at the very end for the return result:

```
short SawToothWave(int samplePart, double frequency, double amplitude) {
    int samplesPerCycle = static_cast<int>(SAMPLE_RATE / frequency);
    int cyclePart {samplePart % samplesPerCycle};
    double halfCycle {samplesPerCycle / 2.0};
    double amp {MAX_AMP * amplitude};

    double result {amp * ((cyclePart - halfCycle) / halfCycle)};
    
    return static_cast<short>(result);
}
```

For the next change, I optimized the control flow in the main program loop. Since it is more often that keys are not pressed, I put the `when key is not pressed` conditional statements before the `when key is pressed` statements, which were contained in an `else if`. Therefore, the program would only check both statements for a given key if it was in fact pressed.

Finally, I reorganized everything into a header and source file, renaming the namespace to `wf` for WaveForm. I put in a lot of work today, and the results were worth it! Very satisfying indeed.

### 2/27/2023
Goal: to create a class for different tuning temperaments. In this class, I included my original `justIntonation` function and a new `equalTemperament` function. To accomplish this, I needed to learn how to declare a class in a header file and define the class in the related source file. I found [this resource](https://www.cppforschool.com/tutorial/separate-header-and-implementation-files.html) helpful. I went ahead and replaced the previous sfmlPractice1 file with the latest one.

Scoured [adafruit.com](https://www.adafruit.com/) this evening in search of the parts I'll need to build my gesture-responsive midi controller. Here's my current list:

- [Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062)
- [Long Flex Sensors](https://www.adafruit.com/product/182)
- [Adafruit LSM6DSOX 6 DoF Accelerometer and Gyroscope](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4438)
- [Lithium Ion Polymer Battery 3.7v 400mAh](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3898)

I'm uncertain about the accelerometer - it might have more features and peripherals than I need.
