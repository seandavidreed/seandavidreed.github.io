I'm a fan of the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). It can do as much or as little as you want it to do, simply providing the directory structure or organizing your content all the way to the look and feel with templates. ersonally, I only wanted Jekyll for its organization, integration with GitHub Pages, and built-in support for markdown and the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating language. Everything else was up to me, the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and little additions like LaTeX support and the [darkmode.js](https://darkmodejs.learn.uno/) widget (really cool and not that little).
