Watched over half of Lecture 7, which Is on SQL and Relational Databases. I’m excited for the possibilities here: I bet I could improve my studentlog dramatically using SQL.

I’m euphoric! I solved Fiftyville and had a blast doing it. Thinking through the logic and seeing my queries access the appropriate data was a thrill - no joke. Some of the most fun I’ve had in this course so far! Done with Week 7; on to Week 8!
